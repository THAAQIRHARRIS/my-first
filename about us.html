                <p>The FEED THE FUTURE organization was founded by three students in Cape Town who were concerned about the lack of access to food for many people, particularly children. They began by collecting leftover food to provide meals to their communities. Over time, this initiative grew into the FEED THE FUTURE organization, which is dedicated to the idea that everyone should "Feed and Thrive."</p>
