                <p>The Heating the Earth organization started with 3 boy which atended the same college in Cape Town CBD
                     had found it consurning how much people mainly kids on how little access the had to food and how 
                     they would be hungry and continuesly asking for money or just warm foods. The 3 boys desided 
                     to take action and create a small group unnamed at the time to collect leftover foods and provide
                      these foods to the people of there communities which had been struggling to gain access to 
                      foods ecspeically warm/hot foods.As time has gone the group would grow in size and take the 
                      name Heating the Earth, Heating being a pun on hot and eating which the group had focus on when
                       providing foods to people in need. </p>
